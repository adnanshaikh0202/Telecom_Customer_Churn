# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This churn prediction model is designed to help businesses predict and identify customers who are likely to churn or leave their service.
By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes historical customer data to generate predictions, enabling proactive retention strategies and targeted interventions to reduce customer churn.

## Project Goals

1. Data Exploration: Analyze customer data to understand churn patterns.
2. Feature Engineering: Identify and create features that may influence churn.
3. Model Training: Develop predictive models using various machine learning algorithms.
4. Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Deployment: Provide insights and predictions that can be integrated into business strategies.
